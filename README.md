Describe your solution to the challenge statement:
Within the current A/V space, there is a lack of accessibility to higher-end equipment, mainly due to both cost prohibitions, as well as general availability. This leaves everyone from casual hobbyists to professional musicians at a serious deficit. To solve this, we are proposing a peer-to-peer audio/visual marketplace focusing on the rent-to-own model. By providing a service that allows enthusiasts of all sorts to engage and interact with other passionate users, the accessibility gap to A/V gear can be closed significantly.

Develop a project vision using the Geoffrey Moore Template in Chapter 1 of the textbook:
For audio-visual technology enthusiasts who don’t have the resources to traditionally acquire gear, our website is a peer-to-peer gear rental/rent-to-own marketplace that allows a wider breadth of people to access gear.

Develop a risk management plan using the risk management process:
Security - Make sure user information is stored securely in our database, and use 2FA authentication methods to verify user accounts.
